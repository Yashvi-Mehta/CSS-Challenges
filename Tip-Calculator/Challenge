2. BUILD A JAVASCRIPT TIP CALCULATOR
Whenever I go out to eat and I’m having a hard time calculating the right tip, I’ll fumble with my phone and search for a “tip calculator” on Google. I couldn’t tell you the name or the url of the one I usually end up using, but it’s a simple JavaScript app. So go ahead and take a swing at making your own tip calculator. This calculator on CodePen by Carolyn Hemmings(opens in a new tab) is a perfect JavaScript sample project that shows the kind of fun JavaScript projects you can build with JavaScript and a little bit of HTML and CSS.
